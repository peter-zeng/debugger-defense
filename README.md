# Debugger Defense

[Live Link](https://debuggerdefense.herokuapp.com/#/)

## Background and Overview

Debugger Defense is a typing game that incorporates gameplay elements from Typing Ninja Hunter on a game map similar to that of a tower defense game, such as Bloons Tower Defense. The game is built primarily with the MERN stack.

Bugs traverse a path through a circuit to production and have words above them. If a bug reaches production with letters above them, the player will lose health. The goal of the game is to kill bugs by typing their respective words before they reach production and achieve the highest score before the player runs out of health. As the level increases, bugs will have longer words for the player to type out. Compete for the highest score on the leaderboard!

## Functionality and MVP
- [ ] User authorization: sign up and log in
- [ ] Game parses user typing input and compares against bug words
- [ ] Import dictionary, create logic to randomly select words based on game-difficulty 
- [ ] Animation: map correctly displays bug movement and death (map render?)
- [ ] Gameplay: game starts, and bugs (word lengths) get progressively more difficult until end, scoring and lives system
- [ ] Saving of userâ€™s high score to database and global high score board
- [ ] Production README
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku

## Technologies and Technical Challenges

### Technologies:
MERN Stack:
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js

### Technical Challenges:
- Animation: bug movement
- Map creation
- Websockets/multiplayer
- Live parsing of user input
- Difficulty scaling and making sure animations align with user input (keeping track of all possible words that can be squashed)

## Things Accomplished Over the Weekend
- Preparatory MERN Twitter project
- Proposal README and workflow organization
